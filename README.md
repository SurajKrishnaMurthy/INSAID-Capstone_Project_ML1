## Key findings:

 - The usage picks up at 6am and follows the trend till 10am when the usage is at its peak. The trend is following the normal day activity as people start off their day with commuting and communicating.
 - The pattern shows that post 10am the usage starts declining and remains constant for most part of the day till 6pm. The trend is in-line with people generally settling down in their daily schedule and carrying on with predicted daily activities.
 - The usage starts declining at 9pm till 4am when the usage is at its low, again in-line with normal daily routine when people generally mark their day off and rest for another day.

## **Recommendations:**

India is home to the second largest and youngest nations in the globe. Over the past few years, the telecom sector has seen a huge growth due to innovation in technology (smartphones, network spectrum) & change in user aspirations & needs. Still INSAID Telecom has low user base. Refer below census data as of 2011 [[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_and_union_territories_of_India_by_population)]. INSAID Telecom users are just a fraction of the census. Based on this and above key findings, we recommend some strategies to increase the user base and user experience.

## Increase user base

 - INSAID Telecom should revise its marketing strategy in the
   under-penetrated markets according to the needs of the local markets.
 - Identify market segments (males, females, professionals, students, businesses, etc.), and relevant product mix (Calls, SMS, Data, etc.) to match with the local markets
 - Different offerings for different markets. For instance, small
   markets (in terms of population) might have different needs (for instance, low call usage and high data usage)
 - Targeted offerings for age-groups. For instance, tie up with online educational apps ex. Byjuâ€™s  learning app for students to attract students (age group < 20 years).
 - Offer attractive data plans ranging from a variety of speeds and data for as short as 1-day to multi-year validity plans.



## Increase user experience

 - Conduct a survey to understand the user experiences across all markets. This might uncover the quality of the INSAID Telecom services in different regions
 - Focusing increasingly on data and value-added services apart from cutting costs through innovative models
 - 24x7 customer support services. AI Chatbot options for customer support, extensive self-help library and community
 - Monitor visitor actions to predict likelihood of purchase, and then proactively engage these visitors with chat or targeted content. Probe for their needs and interests, and answer their questions in real time, dramatically increasing online conversions
 - Providing assistance with account registration, online bill-pay, and other processes up-front reduces contacts needed later, improves collections, and increases customer satisfaction and retention
 - Conduct an audit on Telecom infrastructure & internal systems to analyze the quality of the services across all regions and major mobile brands.
